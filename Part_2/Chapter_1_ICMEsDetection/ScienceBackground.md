# Science Background - Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections

Space weather describes disturbances of the near-Earth environment. Such disturbances can lead to failures of satellites affecting communication and navigation, increase the radiation affecting manned space flight and air traffic, and can lead to power outages. The scientific community tries to understand the processes that lead to intense disturbances of the Earth's magnetic field, so-called geomagnetic storms.

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) launched at the Sun are the dominant triggers of geomagnetic storms. CMEs are large plasma and magnetic field eruptions originating in the solar corona with speeds of several hundred up to thousands of kilometers per second. They occur from once a day at solar minimum to a couple of times per day at solar maximum. The interaction of CMEs with the Earth's magnetosphere often causes strong geomagnetic storms (see {numref}`sketchCMEMag`).

An interplanetary CME (ICME) is the whole in situ structure disturbing the quiet solar wind {cite:p}`rouillard2011`, i.e. the shock, sheath, solar wind pile-up, compression regions, magnetic field structure, driver gas, ejecta wake and/or legs of magnetic loops. Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are a subgroup of ejecta with specific properties, and magnetic clouds (MCs) again are a subgroup of MFRs. An MC has the following observed characteristic properties {cite:p}`burlaga1981`: Inside the MC (i) the magnetic field exhibits a smooth and large rotation, (ii) the plasma $\beta$ is lower than in the surrounding solar wind (i.e.~small plasma pressure and high magnetic field), (iii) the proton temperature is lower than in the solar wind. The magnetic field structure is the important part of an ICME regarding its geoeffectiveness.
