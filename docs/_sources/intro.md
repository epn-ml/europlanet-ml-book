Supervised Classification Problems - A Basic Tutorial
=============================================

Welcome to our machine learning (ML) tutorial. This is a very basic tutorial and it should serve as a first contact point with ML. All of the code in this tutorial is written in Python 3 and the reader should be familiar with at least the basic features of this programming language.

We also recommend setting up a separate virtual environment for the exercises in this tutorial. This prohibits messing up with a working Python installation.

This tutorial is compiled as part of the work package "JRA4 ML - Machine Learning Solutions for Data Analysis and Exploitation in Planetary Science" in the frame of the EU project "Europlanet 2024 Research Infrastructure" (Europlanet 2024 RI).
